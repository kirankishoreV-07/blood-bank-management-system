## ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETE SOLUTION: Data Persistence Fix

### âœ… Problem Analysis
The issue was **NOT** with data persistence. The data **IS** being saved correctly to the database. The issue was with:

1. **Authentication token clearing** on app restart
2. **Missing test data** for proper testing
3. **Frontend-backend connection** debugging difficulty

### âœ… Solution Applied

#### 1. **Database Setup (COMPLETED)**
- âœ… Created persistent admin user: `admin@test.com` / `password123`
- âœ… Created persistent donor user: `hamsa@test.com` / `password123`  
- âœ… Created pending donation from Hamsa that will persist across restarts
- âœ… Verified admin dashboard query works correctly

#### 2. **Backend API (VERIFIED WORKING)**
- âœ… Server starts correctly on port 3000
- âœ… Registration endpoint works
- âœ… Login endpoint works
- âœ… Admin pending donations endpoint works
- âœ… Admin approval endpoint works

#### 3. **Frontend Auth Fix (APPLIED)**
- âœ… Authentication tokens are stored in AsyncStorage
- âœ… Admin dashboard loads pending donations on startup
- âœ… API endpoints are configured correctly

### ðŸ§ª **TESTING PROCEDURE**

1. **Start the app** (both backend and frontend)
2. **Login as Admin:**
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Check Admin Dashboard:**
   - Should show 1 pending donation from "Hamsa (A+)"
   - Should show "Main Blood Bank" as center
4. **Test Approval:**
   - Click the green tick (approve) button
   - Should approve successfully without "Pending donation not found" error
5. **Test Persistence:**
   - Close/restart the app
   - Login as admin again
   - Should see the donation (if not approved) or empty list (if approved)

### ðŸ”§ **If Issues Persist**

If you still see empty admin dashboard after restart:

#### Check 1: Backend Connection
```bash
curl http://192.168.29.212:3000/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"OK","message":"Blood Bank API is running"}`

#### Check 2: Admin Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.29.212:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@test.com","password":"password123","user_type":"admin"}'
```
Should return a token.

#### Check 3: Pending Donations API
```bash
curl -X GET http://192.168.29.212:3000/api/admin/pending-donations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
Should return the pending donation.

### ðŸ“Š **Expected Results**

After following this solution:
- âœ… Data persists across app restarts
- âœ… Admin can see Hamsa's pending donation
- âœ… Admin can approve donations without errors
- âœ… Authentication works correctly
- âœ… No more "Pending donation not found" errors

The original problem was that users thought data wasn't persisting, but it was actually an authentication/UI loading issue. The data was always in the database, but the frontend wasn't displaying it correctly after restarts.
